# Demonstrate POSTing form data, since most examples are JSON
# Per issue: https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest/issues/115

# PyRestTest takes a very low-level approach to support
# submitting request bodies with everything from JSON to images.
# From its point of view, it's just binary data with a header.

# This means that for form data, we will have to manually concatenate fields,
# add separators, and do url encoding as appropriate
# Per: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms
# Eventually this will get a helper method (not yet though)

# The test below will post these form data elements:
# data = {'Name': 'Gareth Wylie',
#   'Age': 24,
#   'Formula': 'a + b == 13%!'
# }
